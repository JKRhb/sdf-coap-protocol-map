1.  Introduction

   This memo defines vocabulary to integrate the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] into Protocol Mappings
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping] for the Semantic Definition
   Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions of Things [RFC9880].

   The vocabulary and "feature-based" approach taken within this
   document is heavily inspired by the CoAP Protocol Binding
   [WoT-CoAP-Binding] for the W3C Web of Things (WoT), which is to be
   used with WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs).  Considering SDF's role as a
   "hub format", we aspire to be able to also take into account CoAP
   vocabulary when converting from and to TDs.

   An important additional aspect to the base protocol-mapping
   specification [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping] is the fact that
   we rely on instance-related messages
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-instance-information] to complement protocol
   information present in SDF models.  Compared to the WoT approach, we
   achieve a stricter separation of model and instance information this
   way, reducing the amount of information that needs to be supplied by
   a Thing itself to a minimum to enable interactions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [RFC9880], [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping],
   and [I-D.ietf-asdf-instance-information] apply.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  CoAP Protocol Mapping

   The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) has been originally
   specified in [RFC7252], but has since been extended via a number of
   specifications that features such as blockwise transfer [RFC7959],
   the observation of resources [RFC7641], or additional transport
   mechanisms [RFC8323] in addition to UDP and DTLS.

   A protocol mapping for CoAP should cover these features, but should
   also be extensible to potential future additions to the CoAP family
   of standards take into account as well.

3.1.  General Considerations

   CoAP can be used with three all three kinds of interaction
   affordances: properties, actions, and events.  The protocol mapping
   for an affordance will always specify the method as well as an href,
   which combines the URI path and potential query parameters for the
   resource the interaction affordance is mapped to.  To differentiate
   between the available transport mechanisms, a URI scheme (with a
   default value of coap for CoAP over TCP) can be supplied as well.

   Other general qualities for CoAP include parameters for blockwise
   transfer, the available and accepted Content-Formats, as well as the
   minimal polling interval that is accepted by the respective CoAP
   server.  Note that since CoAP messages do not allow for the use of
   generic headers as HTTP does, all of these qualities map to
   standardized CoAP options that are registered with IANA.

   In contrast to the WoT approach, the protocol binding information
   that is supplied via this document is targeting the _model_ level.
   That means that information such as URI paths will be shared by all
   Thing instances that adhere to the given model.  The information that
   deviates between device instances, e.g., a device's host name or its
   ipAddress, is provided via instance-related messages
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-instance-information] that pass the values for the
   sdfParameters the protocol mapping defines via designated properties.
   The selected sdfProperty definitions are indicated via JSON pointers
   within the sdfParameters map.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC9880] as well as [RFC7252] apply
   to this document as well.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
