1.  Introduction

   This memo defines vocabulary to integrate the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] into Protocol Mappings
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping] for the Semantic Definition
   Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions of Things [RFC9880].

   The vocabulary and "feature-based" approach taken within this
   document is heavily inspired by the CoAP Protocol Binding
   [WoT-CoAP-Binding] for the W3C Web of Things (WoT), which is to be
   used with WoT Thing Descriptions (TDs).  Considering SDF's role as a
   "hub format", we aspire to be able to also take into account CoAP
   vocabulary when converting from and to TDs.

   An important additional aspect to the base protocol-mapping
   specification [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping] is the fact that
   we rely on instance-related messages
   [I-D.ietf-asdf-instance-information] to complement protocol
   information present in SDF models.  Compared to the WoT approach, we
   achieve a stricter separation of model and instance information this
   way, reducing the amount of information that needs to be supplied by
   a Thing itself to a minimum to enable interactions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The definitions of [RFC9880], [I-D.ietf-asdf-sdf-protocol-mapping],
   and [I-D.ietf-asdf-instance-information] apply.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

5.  Formal Syntax of the SDF Protocol Mapping for CoAP

   This normative appendix describes the syntax of this protocol mapping
   definition using CDDL [RFC8610].

   Via the defined extension points, future specifications may add new
   definitions to the CDDL schema.
